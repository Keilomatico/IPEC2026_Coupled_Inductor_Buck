	abstract = {For wide band-gap device based non-isolated DC/DC converters, operating in critical conduction mode (CRM) is deemed desirable for realizing soft-switching and enabling a high frequency operation. With a significant higher switching frequency compared to the current practice using silicon counterparts, integration of inductors with embedded windings in printed-circuit board (PCB) is feasible. However, for applications with wide input and output voltage ranges, switching frequency of a CRM DC/DC converter varies in a large range, which is undesirable in terms of efficiency and electromagnetic interference. Moreover, the large current ripple associated with CRM operation increases inductor loss compared to continuous conduction mode operation. This issue is more severe for a PCB winding-based planar inductor due to the strong accumulation of magnetomotive force in windings and the non-uniform flux distribution in magnetic cores. In this paper, the large frequency range of a CRM DC/DC converter is minimized by taking advantage of the non-linear inductance for a positively coupled inductor. Furthermore, a high efficiency integrated PCB winding-based planar inductor structure is proposed. Its winding loss is minimized by interleaving windings of different phases. Core loss is reduced by a proposed double-PQ core structure that has less flux crowding compared to the conventional EI-shape core. A 1.8 kW buck converter with input voltage 220–450 V, output voltage 80–140 V, and a peak efficiency of 99\% is presented as an example.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new topology for a highly compact and highly efficient single-phase Power Factor Corrected (PFC) rectifier system. The new topology consists of several interleaved boost stages which operate in a mode called Triangular Current Mode (TCM) in order to simultaneously achieve a high power density as well as a high efficiency. Applying TCM, ZVS is achieved over the full mains period by proper control of the power MOSFETs. The high TCM inductor current ripple is not transferred to the mains as the superposition of all boost cell input currents results in a smooth mains current waveform. Furthermore, one bridge leg operates synchronously to the mains frequency and connects the mains directly to an output rail. This results in very low common mode noise and only a small common mode filter has to be considered. The excellent behavior of this topology also applies to inverter operation.},

Due to the limitation of high-frequency filter inductor on the size of power module, the flux distribution characteristics of coupled inductor and its influence on the volume and loss of magnetic components are deeply studied. With ultra-thin and low loss as objective, a four-pole planar coupled inductor structure based on PCB winding is proposed. Meanwhile, the design method of its structure parameters is given as well as a design example. Finally, an experimental prototype with height of only 7mm, power density of 790W/in3 and maximum efficiency of 99\% is developed.

	title = {Investigation of core-loss mechanisms in large-scale ferrite cores for high-frequency applications},
	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9907281},
	abstract = {In this paper, core-loss mechanisms in ferrite cores are investigated. It is demonstrated that ferrite materials showing almost identical core-losses in the datasheets exhibit a completely different loss-behavior when cores with large cross-sections are manufactured. Therefore, there is a high risk that the wrong ferrite material is selected in the design process of a magnetic component for power electronic applications when only the losses from the datasheets are considered. Consequently, a model is developed which leads to a better understanding of the origin losses in ferrite cores and can be used as powerful tool to design and optimize magnetic components for high-frequency applications. With this model, formulas are derived which allow the calculation of two additional loss contributions which are the electrical polarization losses and the volume eddy current losses. In a detailed experimental study of various ferrite core shapes and sizes the model is verified and clearly shows that for example at 100kHz with a magnetic cross-section of 500mm2, the additional losses cannot be neglected. The dependencies and input parameters are discussed in detail. Finally, a FEM-based workflow is presented and verified by calorimetric measurements. In the future, this workflow can be used to precisely predict the losses of virtual prototypes in a development process i.e., for automotive applications.},
