	abstract = {The 48V - 14V automotive power system is gaining acceptance - due to the increasing number and power rating of electrical and electronic components in vehicles to support advanced functionalities. Multiphase synchronous bi-directional buck/boost converter is currently employed for connecting two bus voltages. However, it has low efficiency at high frequency operation and high EMI noise due to its hard-switching. A zero-voltage transition bi-directional buck/boost converter with coupled inductor is proposed for this application, which provides ZVS for main switches and ZCS for auxiliary switches, and features wide ZVS range and low loss in auxiliary branch. The operating principles including ZVS/ZCS mechanism, details of circuit design, and experimental results from a 1 MHz and 250 W prototype are presented.},

	abstract = {Multiphase interleaving buck converters are widely used in today's industrial point-of-load (POL) converters, especially the microprocessor voltage regulators (VRs). The issue of today's multiphase interleaving buck converters is the conflict between the high efficiency and the fast transient in the phase inductor design. In 2000, P. Wong proposed the multiphase coupledinductor buck converter to solve this issue. With the phase inductors coupled together, the coupled-inductor worked as a nonlinear inductor due to the phase-shifted switching network, and the coupled-inductor has different equivalent inductances during steady-state and transient. One the one hand, the steady state inductance is increased due to coupling and the efficiency of the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter is increased; on the other hand, the transient inductance is reduced and the transient performance of the multiphase coupled-inductor buck is improved. After that, many researches have investigated the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converters in different aspects. However, there are still many challenges in this area: the comprehensive analysis of the converter, the alternative coupled inductor structures with the good performance, the current sensing of converter and the light-load efficiency improvement. They are investigated in this dissertation. The comprehensive analysis of the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter is investigated. The n-phase (n{\textgreater}2) coupled-inductor buck converter with the duty cycle D{\textgreater}1/n hasn't been analyzed before. In this dissertation, the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter is systematically analyzed for any phase number and any duty cycle condition. The asymmetric multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter is also analyzed. The existing coupled-inductor has a long winding path issue. In low-voltage, high-current applications, the short winding path is preferred because the winding loss dominates the inductor total loss and a short winding path can greatly reduce the winding loss. To solve this long winding path issue, several twisted-core coupled-inductors are proposed. The twisted-core coupled-inductor has such a severe 3D fringing effect that the conventional reluctance modeling method gives a poor result, unacceptable from the design point of view. By applying and extending Sullivan's space cutting method to the twisted core coupled inductor, a precise reluctance model of the twisted-core coupled-inductor is proposed. The reluctance model gives designers the intuition of the twisted-core coupled-inductors and facilitates the design of the twisted-core coupled-inductors. The design using this reluctance model shows good correlation between the design requirement and the design result. The developed space cutting method can also be used in other complex magnetic structures with the strong fringing effect. Today, more and more POL converters are integrated and the bottleneck of the integrated POL converters is the large inductor size. Different coupled-inductor structures are proposed to reduce the large inductor size and to improve the power density of the integrated POL converter. The investigation is based on the low temperature co-fire ceramic (LTCC) process. It is found that the side-by-side-winding coupled-inductor structure achieves a smaller footprint and size. With the two-segment B-H curve approximation, the proposed coupled-inductor structure can be easily modeled and designed. The designed coupled-inductor prototype reduces the magnetic size by half. Accordingly, the LTCC integrated coupled-inductor POL converter doubles the power density compared to its non-coupled-inductor POL counterpart and an amazing 500W/in³ power density is achieved. In a multiphase coupled-inductor converter, there are several coupled-inductor setups. For example, for a six-phase coupled-inductor converter, three two-phase coupled inductors, two three-phase coupled-inductors and one six-phase coupled inductors can be used. Different coupled-inductor setups are investigated and it is found that there is a diminishing return effect for both the steady-state efficiency improvement and the transient performance improvement when the coupling phase number increases. The conventional DCR current sensing method is a very popular current sensing method for today's multiphase non-coupled-inductor buck converters. Unfortunately, this current sensing method doesn't work for the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter. To solve this issue, two novel DCR current sensing methods are proposed for the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter. Although the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converters have shown a lot of benefits, they have a low efficiency under light-load working in DCM. Since the DCM operation of the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter has never been investigated, they are analyzed in detail and the reason for the low efficiency is identified. It is found that there are more-than-one DCM modes for the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter: DCM1, DCM2 …, and DCMn. In the DCM2, DCM3 …, and DCMn modes, the phase-currents reach zero-current more-than-once during one switching period, which causes the low efficiency of the multiphase coupledinductor buck converter in the light load. With the understanding of the low efficiency issue, the burst-in-DCM1-mode control method is proposed to improve the light load efficiency of the multiphase coupled-inductor buck converter. Experimental results prove the proposed solution.},

	abstract = {The design of power electronic converters is subject to extreme cost pressure, especially in the automotive sector. Consequently, each component needs to be optimized regarding material and manufacturing cost. The latter is especially important for magnetic components, as the expensive wire-wrapping process has a significant impact on the overall production costs. In this article, a new inductor concept is proposed, where the winding is directly integrated into the printed circuit board (PCB), while at the same time the usually large high-frequency conduction losses are mitigated. This is achieved by using the fringing field around a single air gap or several (distributed) air gaps for compensating the adverse magnetic skin and proximity fields within the winding. Consequently, low ac to dc resistance ratios are achieved and the required copper cross-section of the winding can effectively be reduced. Furthermore, a thermal model for the printed circuit board winding is derived, which allows for designing PCB windings close to the thermal limit, and therefore inductors with very high power densities are obtained. Finally, the findings of this article are verified by experimental measurements and a simplified design sequence is described.},

	abstract = {For wide band-gap device based non-isolated DC/DC converters, operating in critical conduction mode (CRM) is deemed desirable for realizing soft-switching and enabling a high frequency operation. With a significant higher switching frequency compared to the current practice using silicon counterparts, integration of inductors with embedded windings in printed-circuit board (PCB) is feasible. However, for applications with wide input and output voltage ranges, switching frequency of a CRM DC/DC converter varies in a large range, which is undesirable in terms of efficiency and electromagnetic interference. Moreover, the large current ripple associated with CRM operation increases inductor loss compared to continuous conduction mode operation. This issue is more severe for a PCB winding-based planar inductor due to the strong accumulation of magnetomotive force in windings and the non-uniform flux distribution in magnetic cores. In this paper, the large frequency range of a CRM DC/DC converter is minimized by taking advantage of the non-linear inductance for a positively coupled inductor. Furthermore, a high efficiency integrated PCB winding-based planar inductor structure is proposed. Its winding loss is minimized by interleaving windings of different phases. Core loss is reduced by a proposed double-PQ core structure that has less flux crowding compared to the conventional EI-shape core. A 1.8 kW buck converter with input voltage 220–450 V, output voltage 80–140 V, and a peak efficiency of 99\% is presented as an example.},

With conventional Si-based design, the converter operating frequency is typically less than 70 kHz, resulting in a bulky system with 1-2kW/L power density and no more than 95\% efficiency. In this paper, a bi-directional 3.5kW 48V/12V converter is designed using low voltage GaN devices from EPC. Due to the superior performance of GaN devices, the switching frequency of the converter can be pushed to over 200kHz and the whole converter volume and weight are significantly reduced. In the meantime, thanks to the high frequency operation, PCB winding coupled inductors with −0.6 coupling coefficient are adopted to further shrink the system size and simplify the manufacture process. As a result, the converter reaches over 8.7kW/L power density with 97.5\% peak efficiency, which are far beyond the current Si practice.},

The new topology consists of several interleaved boost stages which operate in a mode called Triangular Current Mode (TCM) in order to simultaneously achieve a high power density as well as a high efficiency. Applying TCM, ZVS is achieved over the full mains period by proper control of the power MOSFETs. The high TCM inductor current ripple is not transferred to the mains as the superposition of all boost cell input currents results in a smooth mains current waveform. Furthermore, one bridge leg operates synchronously to the mains frequency and connects the mains directly to an output rail. This results in very low common mode noise and only a small common mode filter has to be considered. The excellent behavior of this topology also applies to inverter operation.},

	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9907281},
	abstract = {In this paper, core-loss mechanisms in ferrite cores are investigated. It is demonstrated that ferrite materials showing almost identical core-losses in the datasheets exhibit a completely different loss-behavior when cores with large cross-sections are manufactured. Therefore, there is a high risk that the wrong ferrite material is selected in the design process of a magnetic component for power electronic applications when only the losses from the datasheets are considered. Consequently, a model is developed which leads to a better understanding of the origin losses in ferrite cores and can be used as powerful tool to design and optimize magnetic components for high-frequency applications. With this model, formulas are derived which allow the calculation of two additional loss contributions which are the electrical polarization losses and the volume eddy current losses. In a detailed experimental study of various ferrite core shapes and sizes the model is verified and clearly shows that for example at 100kHz with a magnetic cross-section of 500mm2, the additional losses cannot be neglected. The dependencies and input parameters are discussed in detail. Finally, a FEM-based workflow is presented and verified by calorimetric measurements. In the future, this workflow can be used to precisely predict the losses of virtual prototypes in a development process i.e., for automotive applications.},

The system has introduced various new technologies such as Starter-Generator which can work as the starter as well as torque provider during the motion of avehicle, advanced regenerative braking, electrically driven rearaxle, electric compressor, electric pumps, electric power steering pump etc. The best feature of the technology is that it can be installed easily in any vehicle segment along with the conventional 12V system, with slight variation in thearchitecture of vehicle, in both gasoline and diesel engine vehicles. The 48V system can provide from 12 to 15kw power, reduced fuel consumption by 10-20\% and reduced exhaust emissions up to 15\%. The technology gives an advanced base for the further trend of future technologies such as advanced electronic powertrains, replacing the conventional mechanical and hydraulic loads from powertrains with the electrical loads and the new electrical components in vehicles, resulting in further improvement in performance and efficiency.

	abstract = {Intermediate bus architecture employing 48-V bus converters is widely used in power supply applications. With the rapid increase of demanded power by these loads, higher efficiency and power density are driving better performance power management solutions. In this article, a Gallium Nitride (GaN) based design of a two-stage solution is proposed. The first stage is a multi-phase Buck for regulation. The second stage is an LLC converter with a fixed switching frequency for isolation. The detailed design and optimization of the LLC converter are studied. To achieve high power density and high efficiency, the transformer design becomes critical at megahertz frequency. The matrix transformer concept is applied and a merged winding structure is used for flux cancellation, which effectively reduces the ac winding losses. A novel primary termination and via structure is proposed, resulting in a great loss reduction. In addition, to study the current sharing of parallel winding layers, a 1-D analytic model is proposed, and a symmetrical winding layer scheme is used to balance the current distribution. Finally, the prototype for the two-stage bus converter is developed, with a peak efficiency of 96\% and a power density of 615 W/in3.},

	abstract = {A zero-voltage switching technique is described that utilizes a resonant transition during a short but finite switching interval. This zero-voltage resonant-transition (ZVRT) switching technique can be applied to conventional buck, boost, and buck-boost power converter topologies that operate with a constant switching frequency and use pulsewidth modulation for output control. Since frequency-dependent losses are greatly reduced in the power transistors, efficient operation at higher switching frequencies ({\textgreater}1 MHz) is allowed. However, conduction losses are increased because ripple currents are increased and synchronous rectification is required. Experimental results are presented for an interleaved flyback converter that operates with ZVRT switching at 1 MHz.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Triangular-current-mode (TCM) modulation guarantees zero-voltage-switching across the mains cycle in AC-DC power converters, eliminating hard-switching with a minor ≈ 30\% penalty in conduction losses over the conventional continuous current mode (CCM) modulation scheme. TCM-operated converters, however, include a wide variation in both switching frequency and switched current across the mains cycle, complicating an analytical description of the key operating parameters to date. In this work, we derive an analytical description for the semiconductor bridge-leg losses in a TCM AC-DC converter, including the rms current and/or conduction losses, switching frequency, and switching losses. For SiC mosfets, we introduce a new loss model for switching losses under zero-voltage-switching, which we call “residual ZVS losses”. These losses include the constant Coss losses found in previous literature but must also add, we find, turn-off losses that occur at high switched currents. The existence and modeling of these turn-off losses, which are due to currents flowing through the Miller capacitance and raise the inner gate source voltage to the threshold level and accordingly limit the voltage slew rate, are validated on the IMZA65R027M1H 650V SiC mosfet. The complete loss model - and the promise of TCM for high power density and high efficiency - is validated on a 2.2 kW hardware bridge-leg demonstrator, which achieves a peak 99.6\% semiconductor efficiency at full load. The proposed, fully-analytical model predicts bridge-leg losses with only 12\% deviation at the nominal load, accurately including residual ZVS losses across load, modulation index, and external gate resistance.},
