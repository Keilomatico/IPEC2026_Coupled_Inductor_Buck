\begin{abstract}
The next generation of automotive vehicles and datacenters requires highly compact and efficient 48 V to 12 V point-of-load converters. This paper investigates the impact of coupling on the electrical properties of 2-phase buck converters operating in triangular current mode to achieve soft-switching. A novel planar inductor geometry with four poles and distributed air-gaps for operation beyond 1 MHz is presented that minimizes copper-losses from external proximity effect. An experimental prototype with 1 kW output achieves an impressive power density of 80 kW/l (1300 W/in³) and a peak efficiency of 96.5\%, demonstrating the efficacy of the inductor structure.

\section{Introduction}
With a growing power demand, power distribution in both conventional and electric vehicles presents an increasing challenge. Traditionally, \qty{12}{\V} are used to distribute the power to all auxiliary devices which requires large cable diameters. Recently, many researchers proposed a \qty{48}{\V} distribution bus to reduce the cost of the wire assembly and/or reduce losses CITE. As most devices are still operating at \qty{12}{\V}, highly compact and efficient point-of-load converters are required. This conversion stage is a critical part of distributed power architectures and its performance has a direct impact on system-level efficiency, thermal design, and spatial constraints. \par
This motivates the use of wide-bandgap semiconductors which offer lower $R_{ds,on}$ and faster switching speeds compared to traditional Si-devices. By increasing the switching frequency, magnetic components and filters can be shrunk significantly enabling very high power densities. Beyond \qty{500}{\kHz}, hard-switched converters are generally unsuitable due to their large switching losses CITE. A lot of research has been done on resonant converters due to their high efficiency and compact design but those are unsuitable when a regulated output voltage is required over a wide input voltage range CITE. \par

%Rewrite this:
This paper presents a highly compact interleaved buck converter for \qty{48}{\V} to \qty{12}{\V} conversion, delivering \qty{1}{\kW} of output power at a power density of \qty{80}{\kW\per\l} (\qty{1300}{\W\per\cubic\inch}). Using a custom planar inductor with distributed air-gaps, maximum power density is achieved while minimizing current crowding and inductor losses.

%Soft-switching is maintained across all load conditions using Triangular Current Mode (TCM). GaN-FETs are employed to achieve fast switching transitions and low gate-drive losses but demand precise dead-time control to minimize reverse conduction losses. Conventionally, this requires expensive characterization across all operating conditions. To address this challenge, a novel circuit is proposed that monitors the reverse conduction duration in real-time, enabling dynamic dead-time optimization. First test results prove the desired operation of this circuit. Testing is still ongoing and currently the design is tested up to \qty{800}{\W} reaching a peak efficiency of \qty{95}{\percent} between 350 and \qty{600}{\W}. Multiple potential sources of unwanted losses have been identified and are currently investigated; efficiency is expected to significantly increase with small design changes. \\ Overall, this thesis shows that high-frequency interleaved buck converters with planar coupled inductors are a viable solution for point-of-load applications.

%The design of the inductor becomes a real challenge in the \unit{\MHz}-range as proximity and skin-effect play a significant role and increase copper losses drastically. A custom coupled inductor using planar magnetics was developed to cope with that. Through the combination of \acp{ganfet}, the custom inductor and soft-switched operation the converter pushes the boundaries of power density and efficiency.

\section{Impact of the Coupling Factor}
The symmetrical coupled inductor consists of two identical coils that are wound in a way, that the flux of one coil links with the flux of the second coil and vice versa with both coils connected on one side. This configuration can be described mathematically using 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:StandardCoupling}
  \begin{bmatrix} v_a \\ v_b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & sbl{k} \\ sbl{k} & 1 \end{bmatrix} \sbl{Lself} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{d\sbl{i1}}{dt}  \\ \frac{d\sbl{i2}}{dt} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
with self-inductance $L_{self}$ and coupling-factor $k$. Note that $k$ can be positive or negative; the impact of that will be analyzed later.
In order to simplify the equations and provide a more intuitive understanding, the equivalent circuit in figure TODO is introduced. Both circuits are electrically equivalent for
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:LoutandLmfromk}
  \begin{aligned}
    \sbl{Lout} & = (1+\sbl{k})\frac{\sbl{Lself}}{2} \\
    \sbl{Lm} & = (1-\sbl{k})\frac{\sbl{Lself}}{2}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The voltage at the virtual central node is now only dependent of the two leg voltages \sbl{v1} and \sbl{v2} decoupling the governing equations:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:TransformerModel}
  \begin{aligned}
    \frac{d\sbl{iout}}{dt} &= \frac{1}{\sbl{Lout}} (\frac{\sbl{v1} + \sbl{v2}}{2}-\sbl{vout}) \\
    \frac{d\sbl{im}}{dt} &= \frac{1}{\sbl{Lout}} (\frac{\sbl{v1} - \sbl{v2}}{2}) \\
    \text{with} \quad \sbl{iout} &= \sbl{i1} + \sbl{i2} \quad \text{and} \quad \sbl{im} = \sbl{i1} - \sbl{i2}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
From this, the differential equations for each interval can be easily calculated and afterwards the important converter parameters. An effective dutycycle \sbl{Deff} can be introduced with $\sbl{Deff} = D$ for $\sbl{D} \leq 0.5$ and $\sbl{Deff} = 1-D$ for $\sbl{D} > 0.5$.
The output ripple is described by
\begin{equation}
  \frac{2\sbl{Vin}\sbl{Ts}}{(1+\sbl{k})\sbl{Lself}}\sbl{Deff}(\frac{1}{2}-\sbl{Deff})
\end{equation}
and shown in figure \ref{fig:OutputRipple}.

  \caption{Comparison of the output current ripple for different coupling factors and constant input voltage. ToDo: Redo with normalized y-axis.}
  \label{fig:OutputRipple}
\end{figure}

The ripple in each leg which is important for soft-switching is given by
\begin{equation}
  \sbl{DeltaIleg} =  \frac{\sbl{Vin}\sbl{Ts}\sbl{Deff}}{2\sbl{Lself}} \Bigl (\frac{2}{1+\sbl{k}}(0.5-\sbl{Deff}) + \frac{1}{1-\sbl{k}} \Bigr )  
\end{equation}
and shown in figure \ref{fig:LegRipple}.
